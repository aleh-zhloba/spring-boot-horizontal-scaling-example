## About
Horizontal scaling is a method of increasing the capacity of a system by adding more application instances. This process is not so trivial as it requires from your service to be either **stateless** or to have some sort of state synchronization mechanism.

This repository contains an example of ready-for-scaling-out **stateful** Spring Boot application, synchronizing updates between instances using PostgreSQL data store and embedded messaging system.
